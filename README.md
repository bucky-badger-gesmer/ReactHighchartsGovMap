# React Congress App
### This is a simple web application to click around a map of the United States and view congressional members from each state, pulling from [ProPublica's Congressional API](https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/). You can view member's contact information as well as voting statistics and Cook Partisan Voting Index (if applicable).

# Pull Down Repo, and run:
`npm install`

`npm run start`
## App will run on `http://localhost:3000`

## Enjoy!
